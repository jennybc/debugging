[R STUDIO SOUND BITE]

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,023
ANNOUNCER: So
without further ado,

3
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:08,690
I'd like to introduce
our first speaker,

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,998
Will Chase, speaking on
the glamour of graphics.

5
00:00:12,998 --> 00:00:14,990
[APPLAUSE]

6
00:00:23,277 --> 00:00:25,860
WILL CHASE: All right, so thank
you for coming today everyone.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,660
And welcome to my
talk on the glamour

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,439
of graphics, which is a talk
on the design of charts.

9
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,190
So if you recognize me,
it's probably from Twitter.

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,350
I tweet excessively.

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,200
And you may also
recognize my website,

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,050
williamrchase.com,
where I post lots

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,830
of blogs about art
and generative art--

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,230
how to make it in
R, R tutorials,

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,750
all sorts of stuff like that.

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,750
So professionally, I
come from academia.

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,600
I worked at Penn State and
then U Penn for many years.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,300
And now, recently, I've
joined Fidelity Investments

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,990
as a Senior
Visualization Analyst

20
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,450
where I'm focusing on visual
design and storytelling

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,320
within our organization.

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,143
I also do freelance
data visualization.

23
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:12,060
So if you're interested
in talking about that,

24
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,260
please get in touch.

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,050
Now the glamour of
graphics that I'm

26
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,008
going to be talking about
today it was actually

27
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:19,830
inspired by Kelly Bodwin.

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,270
As I say, I tweet excessively.

29
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,850
So this is where I
got the inspiration.

30
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,820
And that led me to spend
one of my Saturdays

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,670
making this Glamour
Magazine spoof

32
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,120
which I think was probably
my most viral tweet ever.

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,580
And I may be the
first person to get

34
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,670
invited to talk at RStudio
conf based on a Twitter meme

35
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,810
that I made.

36
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,100
So I'm pretty proud of that.

37
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,350
But I think that there's
actually some substance here.

38
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,810
So this said "Take your
charts from drab to fab".

39
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,400
And that's sort of what we're
going to try to do today.

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,513
So this is the drab.

41
00:01:49,513 --> 00:01:50,930
This is the starting
point, right?

42
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,390
Sorry, Hadley, but it's true.

43
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,900
What we're going to try to do
is get something more like this.

44
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,060
So a little bit about
what this talk is not it's

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,860
not a talk about chart shaming.

46
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,192
So you'll see a lot
of design mistakes

47
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,650
that I'm going to
talk about today.

48
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,830
But if you go to my blog
and look at my portfolio,

49
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,860
you will see all of
those mistakes featured

50
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,750
heavily there.

51
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,450
It's also not a talk
about tools or about what

52
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,360
charts to use in terms of,
like, data visualization.

53
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,647
It's really focused
on the aesthetics.

54
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:22,980
So the reason you should care
about aesthetics in charts

55
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,330
is pretty obvious to me.

56
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,910
But it will help you engage
a much wider audience

57
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,260
with your work.

58
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,660
It'll actually help your
work to be perceived as more

59
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,842
usable and more intuitive.

60
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:34,050
So it's actually been shown
that charts that are more

61
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,120
aesthetically
pleasing are perceived

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,193
by users to be more intuitive.

63
00:02:38,193 --> 00:02:40,110
And finally, they'll
just let you show respect

64
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,860
for your audience.

65
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,300
You know, people spend their
time looking at your charts.

66
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,350
You should spend time
making them look nice.

67
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,067
So when I started
researching this,

68
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,400
I thought it was sort of just
a coincidence-- of grammar

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,830
of graphics, glamour
of graphics, haha.

70
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,590
But it turns out that the
word glamour is actually

71
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,540
derived from the word grammar.

72
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,880
So back in the Middle
Ages, the word grammar

73
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,410
meant all learning.

74
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,340
And that included things
like magic and occult.

75
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,940
And through the ages, that word
sort of morphed into glamour.

76
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,460
And as it did it lost the
association with knowledge

77
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,900
and it became to mean just
a magical spell actually.

78
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,040
And then eventually,
in the 18th century,

79
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,202
the idea of magic sort of
washed away a little bit.

80
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:21,660
And we got the
meaning that we know

81
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,260
today which is the sort of
exciting, illusory, romantic

82
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,740
attractiveness.

83
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,570
So the grammar of
graphics is a tool

84
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,370
that enables us to
concisely describe

85
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,295
the components of a graphic.

86
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:34,670
And what I'm going
to do today is

87
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,730
try to bring this sort of
illusory, romantic quality

88
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,550
of glamour a little bit
closer to a grammar.

89
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,050
So I'm going to
describe a tool that

90
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,865
enables us to concisely describe
the design of a graphic.

91
00:03:45,865 --> 00:03:47,240
So in the grammar
of graphics, we

92
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,800
have these three components of
data aesthetics and geometries

93
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,548
that are really the
core of any chart.

94
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:54,840
And I know there's more layers.

95
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,202
But this is really the core
of how to describe a chart.

96
00:03:58,202 --> 00:04:00,410
What I'm going to describe
in the glamour of graphics

97
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:00,950
is similar.

98
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,230
But I'm going to
describe three layers

99
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,820
that you need to describe
the design of a graphic.

100
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,500
And that's the layout, the
typography, and the color.

101
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,390
So beginning with
layout, I'm going

102
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,910
to talk about three
main concepts today.

103
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,570
And that is alignment,
whitespace, and grids, lines,

104
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,430
and borders.

105
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,350
So beginning with
alignment, I want

106
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,540
to talk about titles first.

107
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,430
Titles should be
top-left aligned usually.

108
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,110
And when I say
top-left aligned, I

109
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,908
don't mean the case
that you see on the left

110
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:35,700
where you have left
aligned with your data.

111
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,850
I mean left aligned all the
way to the edge of your chart

112
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,555
to create a nice clean line
with the edge of your chart.

113
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:42,930
Now previously,
this was actually

114
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,893
kind of tricky to do
with ggplot but luckily

115
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:46,310
in the development
version we have

116
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,870
a new argument that makes
this very, very simple to do.

117
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,150
Next I want you
to please not make

118
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,390
me do like this when
I read your chart.

119
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,550
So I see this a lot
of times, especially

120
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,910
in academic graphics where you
have these really long x-axis

121
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,290
labels.

122
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,525
Nobody wants to do that.

123
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:06,900
So, of course,
it's always better

124
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,193
if you can to flip our
coordinates horizontally.

125
00:05:10,193 --> 00:05:11,610
Or if you can't
manage to flip it,

126
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,160
you can just try to make the
text horizontal by increasing

127
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,118
your spacing and such.

128
00:05:16,118 --> 00:05:17,910
This is a little more
controversial, maybe,

129
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,980
but I also think it's
actually best practice

130
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,220
not to use vertical
axis labels because you

131
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,292
have the same problem.

132
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:25,500
So you can do the same thing.

133
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,900
You can try to make the
text just horizontal.

134
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,500
Or a lot of times you can get
rid of axis labels entirely.

135
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,050
A lot of axis labels are
completely unnecessary-- things

136
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,010
like dates.

137
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,960
In this case, SUV, minivan--

138
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,500
it's obvious these
are types of cars.

139
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,730
And usually by just
including a good title,

140
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,575
you can do away
with axis labels.

141
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:47,210
So when you're thinking
about alignment,

142
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:51,260
you should always try to create
clean lines and symmetry.

143
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,390
And what I want to go
over is a little bit--

144
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,460
this graphic from 538
that I think really

145
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,660
illustrates some
of these points.

146
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,400
So this doesn't have
big blocks of text.

147
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,850
But just to mention, if you
do have big blocks of text

148
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,680
like an infographic
or something,

149
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,990
you want to left align
those most likely.

150
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,410
Left alignment should
sort of be your default.

151
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,590
Right alignment can be used
for labels a lot of times,

152
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,720
so especially like
horizontal bar labels where

153
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,280
the goal is to
create a clean line

154
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,040
with the edge of your data.

155
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,320
And sometimes
subtitles or labels

156
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,810
can be center aligned if
it helps to create symmetry

157
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,657
within the graphic.

158
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:27,740
So in this case, you can
see actually the designer

159
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,753
made a mistake on the 2014 one.

160
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:30,920
It should be center aligned.

161
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,858
But it's slightly off center.

162
00:06:32,858 --> 00:06:34,650
But if you look at the
rest of the graphic,

163
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,323
you can see how this left
alignment, right alignment,

164
00:06:37,323 --> 00:06:39,740
and center alignment sort of
creates this perfect symmetry

165
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,532
within the graphic.

166
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,100
So charts often come with
these extraneous elements.

167
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,360
They're not data.

168
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,310
And a lot of times, they
can distract from the chart.

169
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,750
So I want to talk a little
bit about how to reduce those.

170
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,790
A good example of
this is borders.

171
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,397
You almost never need
a border in a chart.

172
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:00,230
Oftentimes, they just
don't serve a purpose.

173
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,300
And all they do is
distract from your data--

174
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,220
add ink to the page.

175
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,580
Another thing is grid lines.

176
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,960
I understand that
there's reasons

177
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,820
to have grid lines sometimes.

178
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,600
But I encourage you
to always question

179
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,910
the purpose of every grid line.

180
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,370
Do you need horizontal
grid lines in every case?

181
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,750
Do you need minor grid lines?

182
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,080
If not, please remove them.

183
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,970
If you do need them,
I encourage you

184
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,897
to make them as light
and as small as possible

185
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:27,980
so that they sort of
disappear into the background

186
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,278
rather than distracting
from your data.

187
00:07:31,278 --> 00:07:33,320
Another thing that distracts
from your data a lot

188
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,210
is legends,
particularly when you

189
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,300
have like a big blob of a legend
off to the right-hand side

190
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,527
of your chart.

191
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:41,360
It's not a very good
flow within your chart.

192
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,872
So I recommend, if
you have legends,

193
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:44,330
you put them right
below the titles

194
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,240
where it creates a nice
flow with your chart.

195
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,960
A better solution even is
to directly label your data.

196
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,410
Or my favorite solution
is to use colored text

197
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,100
to indicate your
legend in the title.

198
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,590
And this will now be possible
with the new gridtext

199
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,450
package, which I think Claus is
talking about this afternoon.

200
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,013
So a few words about whitespace.

201
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:10,430
This is particularly
relevant when

202
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,010
you're looking at things like
dashboards and infographics

203
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,510
where you're laying out
a lot of charts together.

204
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,970
And what I often
see is people want

205
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,310
to cram as much information
as they can possibly

206
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,300
get onto the page.

207
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,630
But what that ends
up resulting in

208
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,730
is that you can't even
understand any of it.

209
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,070
Your eye has no idea
where to go on the page.

210
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,130
And so your charts really
need room to breathe.

211
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,070
So I always recommend
it's like garlic--

212
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,440
you take as much white
space as you think you need,

213
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,340
and then triple it.

214
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,900
So that's sort of the
foundation of building

215
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,880
a nice chart is the layout.

216
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,620
And next up, I'm going
to talk about typography.

217
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,140
So typography is a very
sort of vast subject.

218
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,670
It has a lot of details in it.

219
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,080
And I can't cover
them all today.

220
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,790
But what I highly,
highly recommend

221
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,060
you do is go to
practicaltypography.com.

222
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,223
This is a completely free,
open-source online book

223
00:09:02,223 --> 00:09:03,890
that will basically
teach you everything

224
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,260
you could need to
know about typography

225
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,520
in a very concise way.

226
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,920
It'll take about three hours
to read cover to cover.

227
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,590
And it will vastly improve
the design of everything

228
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,840
that you write.

229
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,840
But I do want to touch a
little bit on fonts, hierarchy,

230
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,380
and a couple of dataviz
specific concerns.

231
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,560
So the font that you choose
really matters in a chart.

232
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,958
It especially affects the
tone of your graphic, right?

233
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,750
You can send a completely
different message

234
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,150
based on the font you choose.

235
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,850
And it can also really affect
the legibility of your graphic,

236
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,990
right?

237
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,502
It's pretty easy to
have misunderstandings

238
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:39,710
if you choose the wrong font.

239
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,620
This is important.

240
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,720
And the unfortunate thing is
that most people will just

241
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,790
go for the system
font-- the default font.

242
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,630
And that's sad because
most system fonts

243
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,490
are pretty terrible.

244
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,790
I'm sorry to tell you.

245
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,980
Most of them were
designed for the screens

246
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,990
that we had in the
1990s, which were

247
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,430
all pixilated and terrible.

248
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,312
And on modern screens,
they look pretty ugly.

249
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:07,020
So if you're a
professional organization,

250
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,515
you might buy a
professional font.

251
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:10,140
But for most of you
in the room, you'll

252
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,450
probably be looking
at free fonts.

253
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,730
And the good news
is that, in 2020, we

254
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,280
have a wealth of wonderfully
designed, beautiful, free

255
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,660
fonts available easily
at fonts.google.com.

256
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,690
These are some of my favorites
for data visualization.

257
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,220
I really like the
Source family it

258
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,230
has a sans serif variety, serif
variety, mono spaced variety.

259
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,520
And they're all available and
lots of weights and sizes.

260
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,770
So next, I want to touch a
little bit upon hierarchy--

261
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,450
a typographic hierarchy.

262
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,330
So a typographic
hierarchy is just

263
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,420
a way of encoding an
order of importance

264
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,310
in your type that
helps to navigate

265
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,385
your readers through your
chart or through your document.

266
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:53,260
And there's several ways
to create hierarchy.

267
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,410
So this is a case
where we have none.

268
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,530
The easiest way to create
hierarchy is with size.

269
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,780
But you can also do
it with font weight,

270
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,080
with color, with spacing.

271
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,320
You can do it with a
contrasting typeface,

272
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,500
or, ideally, a combination
of all of these things.

273
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,810
And learning the rules of
how to create a hierarchy,

274
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,030
you know, what should
you make your title

275
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,130
versus your subtitle
versus your body text

276
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,830
is just a skill that takes
a little bit of practice.

277
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,450
But there are some
more specific tips

278
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,348
in the practical typography
book that I mentioned earlier.

279
00:11:25,348 --> 00:11:27,640
And finally, I want to talk
about numbers a little bit.

280
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,810
So we use numbers all the
time in data visualization.

281
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,090
Some fonts have what's
called old style numbers.

282
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,400
I recommend do not use these.

283
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,980
Most of those fonts will also
have lining numbers, which

284
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,620
have all the same x height.

285
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,120
And in a similar
vein, you also want

286
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,640
to choose a font that
has tabular numbers.

287
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,130
Tabular numbers all
have the same width

288
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,990
so that when you make
a table or something,

289
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,110
everything will line up
in a nice perfect column.

290
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,530
So having covered the layout
and the typography of a chart,

291
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,840
I want to talk a little
bit about the color--

292
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,970
everyone's favorite topic.

293
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,470
So there's a lot
of tools out there.

294
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,960
I know people are probably
familiar with things like

295
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,420
colorbrewer and there's other R
packages that will basically

296
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,230
just choose a color for you--
choose a color palette for you.

297
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,232
What I want to do today
is try to give you

298
00:12:15,232 --> 00:12:17,190
a little bit of information
that will hopefully

299
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,130
help you to choose your
own color palettes.

300
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,130
The truth is, though,
that color is really hard.

301
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,880
So I don't want to lie
to you and tell you

302
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,800
it's going to be easy.

303
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,460
It's something I
still struggle with.

304
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,400
And it's just such
a complex subject

305
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,420
that it takes a lot of practice.

306
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,110
But, I think there are a few
things that I can tell you

307
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,670
today about color
theory and then

308
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,980
a few sort of
practical tips to help

309
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,638
improve your usage of color.

310
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:43,180
So one of the chief complaints
I get from people is they say,

311
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,222
I just don't know what
colors look good together.

312
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,255
How do I know what
looks good together?

313
00:12:47,255 --> 00:12:49,630
This is a case where the color
wheel can really help you.

314
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,910
So the color wheel like we
all know from grade school--

315
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,500
it looks like this.

316
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,703
And there's several
types of palettes

317
00:12:57,703 --> 00:13:00,120
you can choose from the color
wheel that will usually have

318
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,680
colors that go well together.

319
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,752
So if you want to choose
a high contrast palette,

320
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:06,210
you can choose a
complementary one.

321
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,207
That means opposite
sides of the color wheel.

322
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:11,040
You can also choose
analogous color palettes

323
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,743
which all come from the same
side of the color wheel.

324
00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:15,660
And there's triadic which
are sort of laid out

325
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,370
in a triangle like this.

326
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,540
And there's several other
color palettes as well.

327
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,070
There's split complementary,
quadratic, and lots of others.

328
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,570
And you can read a little bit
more about sort of the feeling

329
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,010
that all these color
palettes give you.

330
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,302
But this is a nice way to
sort of get started if you're

331
00:13:31,302 --> 00:13:34,152
looking to choose some hues.

332
00:13:34,152 --> 00:13:35,610
So once you choose
those, you might

333
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,277
want to adjust your
colors a little bit.

334
00:13:37,277 --> 00:13:39,400
And I want to highlight
the HSL color space.

335
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,390
So this is a way of
describing color in contrast

336
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,030
to something like RGB.

337
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,800
HSL stands for the hue,
saturation, and lightness

338
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,920
of a color.

339
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,770
So the hue is the
actual color itself--

340
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,710
red, green, blue.

341
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:55,440
The saturation is the amount
of color you have there.

342
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,800
And the lightness is how
light or dark a color is.

343
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,320
So this is an example
where we have a red hue.

344
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,977
And if we turn
down the saturation

345
00:14:02,977 --> 00:14:05,310
you can see that it'll basically
drain all the color out

346
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:05,810
of there.

347
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,825
It's very dull.

348
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:08,910
If we turn up the
saturation, it's

349
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,970
going to become very
rich and vibrant.

350
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,622
And if we turn
down the lightness,

351
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:15,330
we can see we still
have a richness here.

352
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,790
But now it's much darker.

353
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,110
And if we turn it up, it'll
become more lighter obviously.

354
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,130
But you can see how this
is a very easy way when

355
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,720
you pick a color and
you say, oh but I

356
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,970
wish it were a little bit
lighter or a little bit more

357
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,230
saturated or less saturated.

358
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,000
This is a much more
intuitive mental model

359
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,220
I think of how to
adjust your colors.

360
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,720
And there's lots
of online tools you

361
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,220
can use where you
can stick it in

362
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,527
and it'll sort of allow
you to adjust the sliders

363
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:40,860
a little bit for your saturation
and lightness and such.

364
00:14:43,535 --> 00:14:45,410
So that was a little
bit of the color theory.

365
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,040
Now some other practicalities
of how I choose color.

366
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,470
So I'm sort of a color pirate.

367
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,790
I use my favorite tool in
the world all the time,

368
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,202
which is the eyedropper tool.

369
00:14:56,202 --> 00:14:58,160
So this is a tool if
you're not familiar-- it's

370
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,360
present in all kinds
of design programs.

371
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,420
And you can get apps
on your computer.

372
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,810
On my Mac, I like to use
one called Color Slurp.

373
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,110
On Windows, I like Instant
Eyedropper where you can just

374
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,300
click the tool, pick any
pixel on your screen,

375
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,580
and will return
the color for you.

376
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,820
So I use this all the time.

377
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,850
If I see a data
visualization, for example,

378
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,980
that I really like where
I love the color palette.

379
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,410
I'll just take my eyedropper,
pick those colors.

380
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,380
I do this with websites,
with photographs.

381
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,900
And then I use the HSL
sliders to adjust the colors

382
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,040
afterwards.

383
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,670
A good example of this is this
generative conference badge

384
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,440
that I designed this summer.

385
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,163
And I got the inspiration
from my mom's day planner.

386
00:15:36,163 --> 00:15:38,330
I went to visit my parents
and saw this day planner.

387
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,850
And I really liked it so I
just took a picture of it.

388
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,950
And when it came time
to design the graphic,

389
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,070
I took my eyedropper tool,
picked all the colors I liked,

390
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,590
adjusted them a little
bit with the HSL sliders,

391
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,060
and then had my color palette.

392
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,730
And finally, I want to talk a
little bit about backgrounds.

393
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,540
So one thing I actually like
a lot about the default ggplot

394
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,182
theme is that it doesn't
use a white background.

395
00:16:02,182 --> 00:16:03,640
White backgrounds
are not terrible.

396
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,890
There's lots of-- you know,
there's a time and place.

397
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,020
But I think they're very
overused, especially

398
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,570
because white is a very
harsh color especially

399
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,590
on digital screens.

400
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,110
White is a very aggressive
and bright color.

401
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,200
So I encourage you to sort of
not necessarily go straight

402
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,520
to white as a
background as a default.

403
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,220
And instead, explore
some other options.

404
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,970
Recently I've really liked
this sort of ivory color.

405
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,760
A light gray color
can also be very nice.

406
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,990
Or dark backgrounds are
fun to experiment with.

407
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,978
But if you do go with
a dark background,

408
00:16:31,978 --> 00:16:34,270
just like I don't recommend
a pure white background all

409
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,988
the time, I would be
careful unless you

410
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:38,530
have a specific
reason about choosing

411
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,220
a pure black background.

412
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,720
So to review a
little bit, I have

413
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,760
talked about how
you can establish

414
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,580
a good layout in your
data visualizations

415
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,370
by creating clean
lines and symmetry,

416
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,870
reducing clutter, and
increasing white space.

417
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:59,590
And you can use good fonts,
not use system fonts,

418
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,660
and establish a
typographic hierarchy

419
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,858
to help guide readers
through your visualization.

420
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,400
And then, hopefully,
I have given you

421
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,869
a little bit of
the tools that you

422
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:10,510
need to start coming up
with your own palettes

423
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,810
and choosing your
own color palettes.

424
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,119
And with that, I
will say thank you.

425
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,015
And that's it.

426
00:17:18,015 --> 00:17:19,955
[APPLAUSE]

427
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:26,500
ANNOUNCER: Thanks so much, Will.

428
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,359
I have questions
from the audience,

429
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,740
while Tyler, you can come get
set up a little if you want.

430
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,970
The first one is, do you have
any specific recommendations

431
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,515
for aesthetics for maps?

432
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:41,890
WILL CHASE:
Aesthetics for maps-

433
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,700
I mean, essentially all the
same rules apply, right?

434
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,300
Maps you want to
try to reduce a lot

435
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,120
of times the
extraneous elements.

436
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,760
So maps often have a lot of
extraneous elements and borders

437
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,210
and such.

438
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,140
And sometimes you're
going for a thematic map.

439
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,932
You actually might want
to emphasize those.

440
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:04,600
But if you're trying to go for
a very clean, easy to read map,

441
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,532
you have to think about that.

442
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:07,990
There's also a lot
to be considered

443
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,510
in maps with iconography.

444
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,000
So using proper icons
that help readers identify

445
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,040
whatever you're looking for
or using a really careful type

446
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,600
hierarchy.

447
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,590
So you have to really, really
be careful about your type

448
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,110
hierarchy and spend a lot of
time designing that for a map

449
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,350
since you have so many
labels and so much type.

450
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,550
ANNOUNCER: Next one is shouldn't
a binding constraint for color

451
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,687
be color blind friendliness?

452
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:35,270
WILL CHASE: Yes,
absolutely it should.

453
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,853
I didn't have time
to talk about this.

454
00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:38,370
One of my slides
got cut for time.

455
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,940
But another very important
thing to do in color

456
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,773
is accessibility.

457
00:18:41,773 --> 00:18:43,940
So you should always be
checking your color palettes

458
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,260
for color blindness
and also for contrast.

459
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,815
And there's easy websites
where you can do that.

460
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:51,440
ANNOUNCER: Why is it
better for a title

461
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,947
to be left aligned
instead of centered?

462
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:57,530
WILL CHASE: The reason is mainly
because, in Western countries

463
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,730
at least, humans read
from the top left.

464
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,730
So that's where your eye
goes first on the page.

465
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,230
There's several eye
tracking studies

466
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,030
that show that
your eye goes first

467
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,980
to the top left of the page and
then to the middle of the page.

468
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,680
And so putting the
title at the top left

469
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,110
is basically reducing
the amount of work

470
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,860
that the reader has to do
to get to the information.

471
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,520
ANNOUNCER: Couple more-- how
long should one typically spend

472
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,890
on creating/designing a chart?

473
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:26,900
How long does it typically
take you to create one?

474
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,300
WILL CHASE: To create a
simple design, like something

475
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,717
I would do for
Fidelity, you know,

476
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:34,430
something that just needs to
look clean and and readable, I

477
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,390
spend, I don't know, maybe a
couple hours designing a chart.

478
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,280
If I'm designing
something more thematic

479
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,980
or something sort of a
personal project, something

480
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,935
more creative, I mean,
it can take months.

481
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,810
You know it's not all
a month of sitting down

482
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,280
just like designing nonstop
for eight hours a day.

483
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,760
But it's months of like
laying in bed at 4:00 AM

484
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,085
thinking about colors.

485
00:19:56,085 --> 00:19:56,960
ANNOUNCER: That's it.

486
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,510
Thoughts on Tufte theme charts--

487
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,520
WILL CHASE: I like it.

488
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,860
ANNOUNCER: --question mark.

489
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,880
WILL CHASE: That's all I'll say.

490
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,230
ANNOUNCER: Great,
and then oh, what

491
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,452
tool has been used for creating
the presentation slides?

492
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:13,910
WILL CHASE: The
presentation slides

493
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,900
were created with Keynote.

494
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,983
And let me emphasize,
actually, I want to clarify.

495
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,460
I like the Tufte
R Markdown theme.

496
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,460
I don't always agree with
everything Tufte says.

497
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,377
So Tufte-- if you read
like his dataviz books,

498
00:20:23,377 --> 00:20:26,420
he has a lot of opinions.

499
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,860
I don't agree with all of those.

500
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,600
But there is a Tufte
R Markdown theme

501
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,110
that's based on some of his
writings which I really like.

502
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,860
ANNOUNCER: And then
the last one before we

503
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,340
let Tyler get
going is how do you

504
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,550
deal with viewers using monitors
that might render colors

505
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,820
slightly differently?

506
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,790
WILL CHASE: Yeah
it's a good question.

507
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,350
I mean, there's very little you
can do about that to be honest.

508
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,110
I don't have a magical solution
to change everyone's monitors

509
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,400
for you.

510
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,840
All I can say is that we are
lucky to live in 2020 when

511
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,800
people have--

512
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,140
most people have more
high resolution monitors.

513
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,480
So we can use things
like fonts that

514
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,390
